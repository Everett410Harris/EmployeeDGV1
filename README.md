# EmployeeDGV1
CRUD application using C#, .NET, &amp; SQL Database

CRUDFormApp
This project is a CRUD Windows Forms Application. The application allows users to create, read, update, delete, and also search employees, through the window's form. I decided to use SQL for my database, where the data is saved, updated, or deleted, by the user of the form. I plan to add a Data Grid View, as to aloow the user to see that, the data stored is correct or to make changes as needed.

TO-DO
 Create window form with:

- [ ] Make labels for title and input boxes for users.
- [ ] Add input boxes.
- [ ] Add buttons for users to create, update, delete, and search database.
- [ ] Add DGV to window's form application.
 Configure SQL with a new database and add connection to CRUD application.

 Add Unit Test to application.

 Add the appropriate comments throughout code.
